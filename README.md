This is a project submission for the Man vs Machine hackathon. I love programming in python, so this project was a lot of fun. And I didn't use an AI in any form today.

This project uses a version of Order of merit or Borda method for voting. Read about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count

And the demo video is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tJUGzExaFI

Cheers!
