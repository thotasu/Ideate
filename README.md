This is a project submission for the Man vs Machine hackathon. I love programming in python, so this project was a lot of fun. And I didn't use an AI in any form today.

This project uses a version of Order of merit or Borda method for voting. Read about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count

And the demo video is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tJUGzExaFI
(Video shows a version that had a bug. Did you notice it showed goal 2 website when the top choice was 1? Anyway core logic didn't have any bugs.)

Cheers!
